DNA extraction from single “Globodera pallida Pa1” cysts
 
General advice :
always clean the bench and pipettes with 70% Ethanol before starting
always spin down tubes before opening the lid 
always use filter-tips for pipettes

 Washing and picking of cysts
Transfer cysts to glass bowl
Add 100µl EB or STW
Transfer cysts to tube with yellow tip (size selection based on those that do not pass)
Add 1ml EB; Add 5µl Tween20; mix by inversion
Centrifuge 3’ @ 15,000G; RT 
Transfer floating cysts to individual tubes (minimizing amount of liquid) and place cyst near the 100µl mark
Freeze @ -80ºC or proceed with next step

 DNA extraction 

Preparation
Liquid Nitrogen, tweezers, autoclaved white pestles
Ice bucket (for Proteinase K)
Dry bath @ 56ºC
Reagents 
	number of samples = N, final volume = Vf (11µl - 21µl)
N x 600µl of Qiagen Cell Lysis Buffer
N x 5µl Proteinase K (20mg/ml)
N x 200µl Qiagen Protein Precipitation Buffer
N x 4 µl RNAse A (100mg/ml)
N x 0.25µl Glycogen solution (20mg/ml)
N x 600µl Isopropanol
N x 600µl 70% Ethanol
N x Vf µl Elution buffer

Start 

 Freeze all tubes in liquid nitrogen
 Processing one tube at a time, do :
 Open tube carefully w/o breaking off the lid
 Crush cyst using a white pestle through twisting; leave pestle in the tube
 Add 600µl Qiagen Cell Lysis Buffer; remove pestle carefully so that tissue remains in the tube
 Add 5µl Proteinase K (20mg/ml) 
 Mixed by vortexing
 Incubate samples O/N @ 56ºC; mix by inversion whenever possible

Next Day

 Add 4µl of RNAseA (100mg/ml), mix by inversion
 Incubate 10’ @ RT
 Add 200µl Qiagen Protein Precipitation Buffer; vortex briefly
 Incubate 10’ on ice
 Centrifuge 10’ @ 15,000G; 4ºC
 Transfer supernatant with blue tip to new tube
 Add 0.25µl Glycogen solution (20mg/ml); mix by inversion
 Add 600µl Isopropanol; mix by inversion
 Incubate O/N @ -20 ºC

Next Day

 Centrifuge 45’ @ 17,000G; 4ºC; remove supernatant
 Add 600µl 70% Ethanol; mix by inversion
 Centrifuge 30’ @ 17,000G; 4ºC; remove supernatant
 Dry pellet under fume hood for 1h
 Add Vf µl Elution buffer; incubate 1h @ RT (or O/N @ 4ºC)
 Store sample(s) @ -20ºC
